              Failure of part or all of the cerebrum (focal or diffuse dysfunction) causes loss of one or more **higher functions** of the brain.

              **Focal** seizures affect only one part of the brain, so the signs and symptoms tend to be confined to one aspect of brain function: twitching, abnormal perception, etc.

              **Intentional tremor** is shaking that emerges when a person attempts to make an **intentional** movement, such as picking up an object.

              First, let's review the anatomy of the motor nerves:
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Motor signals originate in the <b>primary motor cortex</b> of the frontal lobe, anterior to the central sulcus.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The upper motor neuron travels down the spinal cord until it reaches the appropriate level, then synapses with a **lower motor neuron** in the ventral gray horn.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The lower motor neuron then carries the signal out the ventral root and to the skeletal muscle, synapsing with the muscle at the <b>neuromuscular junction</b>.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              In an **upper motor neuron lesion**, the damage is either in the brain or in the upper spinal cord, **above** where the two neurons synapse in the ventral gray horn.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This means that the <b>brain</b> is cut off from the muscle, but the spine and the muscle are <b>still communicating normally</b>.</p>

              A **coup** injury is an injury to the brain due to head trauma, which occurs **directly** from the source of the trauma.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">For example, if you hit the <b>front</b> of your head, a coup injury will result in damage to the <b>front</b> of the brain.</p>

              A **contrecoup** injury is a secondary injury which can occur due to the momentum from the blow slamming the brain against the **opposite side** of the skull.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">For example, if you hit the <b>front</b> of your head, a contrecoup injury will result in damage to the <b>back</b> of the brain.</p>

              Meningitis—inflammation of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord—can be caused by several forms of infection, but fungal meningitis is particularly **rare**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is usually observed as an <b>opportunistic</b> infection in patients who are <b>already immunocompromised</b>, such as those with AIDS.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by the death of neurons in part of the **substantia nigra**, an area of the basal ganglia in the midbrain.

              These are largely **dopaminergic** neurons, meaning that the primary neurotransmitter that they emit is **dopamine**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The deficiency of dopamine caused by the death of these neurons is often treated with <b>L-DOPA</b>, a precursor to dopamine that makes it easier for the brain to produce it.</p>

              What process leads to the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS?) What is the hallmark of this disease?

            <textarea data-template>
              Multiple sclerosis is characterized by the loss of **oligodendrocytes** and the **demyelination** (destruction of the **myelin sheath**) of neurons in the central nervous system.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is believed to be at least partially autoimmune (type IV hypersensitivity,) caused by T cells attacking myelin and causing inflammation and scarring of the neuronal axons.</p>

              MS has many varied symptoms, but one telltale sign is impaired eye movement, particularly paralysis of the **medial rectus** muscle.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This causes the eyes to no longer be parallel when looking to the sides; when looking right, for example, the right eye will face right but the left eye will face forward.</p>

              In which sex is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is more common? What causes the deterioration that patients experience?

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              ALS is caused by the progressive death of **motor neurons**, resulting in spasticity, twitching, and over time, denervation atrophy.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This loss of motor function is eventually fatal as the worsening nerve damage begins to cause respiratory failure. Most ALS patients die within 3-4 years of diagnosis.</p>

              ALS is **slightly** more common in men than in women (about 20%,) particularly among those diagnosed at a young age.
