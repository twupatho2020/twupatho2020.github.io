              **Atopy** (or being "atopic") refers to an individual's hypersensitivity to non-harmful environmental factors—in other words, having **allergies**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Atopy can present itself in any number of ways depending on the particular allergen(s) someone is sensitive to:</p>

              **Anaphylaxis** is a severe and potentially **life-threatening** form of type I hypersensitivity reaction, caused by an extreme immune response to an allergen.

              Type II reactions are classified as **tissue-specific**, because they are caused by the immune system responding to a **particular type** of tissue (either autoimmune or alloimmune.)

              Unlike type I reactions, type II reactions are mediated by **IgG** and **IgM**.

              Type III reactions are classified as **immune complex-mediated** and typically have **systemic** effects, targeting more than one organ (although the effect may be **greatest** in one organ.)

              When antibodies are created targeting the body's **own** proteins (autoantigens,) immune complexes can accumulate **faster** than the immune system can deal with them.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These complexes can get "stuck" in various tissues, leading to <b>inflammation</b> and <b>tissue damage</b> when leukocytes show up to deal with them.</p>

              Describe a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Type IV reactions are classified as **cell-mediated** and are the only type of hypersensitivity reaction which **do not** directly involve antibodies.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Rather, they are caused by <b>overactive</b> CD4 "helper T" cells triggering CD8 cytotoxic "killer T" cells to induce <b>apoptosis</b> of healthy cells.</p>

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              In contrast to types I-III, which tend to occur fairly quickly in response to a stimulus, type IV are also known as **delayed hypersensitivity reactions** and can take several **days** to develop after exposure.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Examples include <b>contact dermatitis</b> (e.g. poison ivy,) <b>type 1 diabetes mellitus</b>, <b>inflamatory bowel disease</b>, <b>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</b>, and <b>multiple sclerosis</b>.</p>

              Type IV hypersensitivity is also responsible for the induration and erythema seen in a positive <b>TB skin test</b>, which is why you need to return in 2-3 days after placement of the intradermal tuberculin to have the test read.

            <textarea data-template>
              **Autoimmunity** refers to any type of hypersensitivity reaction in which the immune system is targeting or attacking the body's **own tissues**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These are typically going to fall into categories II through IV (remember that type I represents allergies in which there is an external irritant.)</p>

              Like other type III reactions, RA tends to flare up and then remit over time. However, cumulative damage can cause the symptoms to worsen as the disease progresses.

              Stage 1 (**early RA**) is still mild and hasn't yet caused any permanent damage. The synovial lining of the joint becomes inflamed, causing swelling.

              Stage 3 (**severe RA**) begins to involve the bone, as the cartilage is worn down and the joint begins to malfunction. This is when the classic joint deformities of RA tend to appear.

              When a person is exposed to antigens which they do not **naturally have** on their own RBCs, this can lead to the immune system **attacking** the donated blood cells.

              Graft rejection falls into three categories based on the speed with which it occurs:

              **Graft-versus-host disease** (GvHD) and **host-versus-graft disease** (HvGD) are two examples of **alloimmunity**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The process in each is similar, but as the names suggest, they occur in <b>different directions</b>.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              In **graft-versus-host disease**, some WBCs from the organ or tissue **donor** make their way into the recipient, often in bone marrow or stem-cell transplants.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These cells recognize their new environment as foreign, causing them to attack the <b>recipient's body</b>.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              In **host-vs-graft disease**, it is the **recipient's** immune system that recognizes the implanted organ or tissue as foreign and attacks the new tissues.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This results in the new tissue being damaged or destroyed, in a process known as <b>transplant rejection</b>.</p>
