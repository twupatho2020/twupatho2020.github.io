              Describe the composition of blood. What is the difference between plasma and serum? What is the difference between collecting blood in green- and red-topped tubes?

              Why do dark urine and light feces signal liver disease? Which form of bilirubin is excreted in bile?

            <textarea data-template>
              Let's review the unit on liver disease—unconjugated **bilirubin** is produced as a byproduct of hemolysis during the recycling of old RBCs.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Unconjugated bilirubin is combined with acid to produce <b>conjugated</b> bilirubin, which is then normally excreted into the bile.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              In liver disease, bilirubin either **fails to be conjugated** due to hepatocyte damage, or **fails to be excreted** due to cholestasis. This results in an increase in bilirubin **in the blood**, which can cause jaundice.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Decreased levels of bilirubin in the intestines and increased levels in the blood (excreted in the kidneys) lead to lighter stool and darker urine.</p>

              The protein **plasminogen**, produced in the liver, plays an important role in the breakdown of blood clots.

              tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) is a naturally-occuring enzyme that is **slowly** released by damaged cells, **activating** the plasminogen contained in clots by converting it to **plasmin**.

            <textarea data-template>
              **tPA** and **streptokinase** are both thrombolytic drugs, but tPA is **fibrin-specific** meaning that it acts **only** on fibrin and not on clotting factors.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Combined with its short half-life, this makes tPA great for treating acute blood clots without causing sustained systemic thrombolysis.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              In contrast, streptokinase is **fibrin non-specific**, meaning it also breaks down **fibrinogen**, causing systemic suppression of **new** clots and increasing the risk of bleeding.

              Generally speaking, anemia results in a systemic decrease in the **oxygenation** of tissues.

              These malformed cells can become tangled with each other and stuck in the arteries, leading to sudden episodes of pain referred to as **sickle cell crisis</b>**.

              Nutritional anemia is linked to a <b>deficit of nutrients</b> required for proper RBC synthesis (iron, B<sub>12</sub>, folate.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Aplastic anemia is a <b>very rare</b> form of anemia characterized by the <b>underproduction</b> of many types of blood cells, including RBCs. It is potentially fatal and is treated with bone marrow transplant.</p>
