              **Angina pectoris** is defined as **ischemic cardiac pain** caused by an imbalance in the **supply and demand** of **oxygen** to the heart.

              The **myocardium** (heart muscle) receives oxygenation through the four **coronary arteries** that run along the **outside** of the heart.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">If these arteries are delivering <b>less oxygen</b> than the heart needs to operate, the result is <b>ischemia</b> and thus <b>angina</b> (pain.)</p>

              Angina falls into one of **three categories**:
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Stable angina</b> is <b>predictable</b>, usually occuring with <b>physical exertion</b> and thus increased oxygen <b>demand</b> by the heart.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">As such, it is relatively easy to treat with <b>nitrate</b> vasodilators such as NTG, which can be taken <b>before</b> exertion to prevent the angina from occurring.</p>

              **Unstable angina** is **more serious** than stable angina and occurs **unpredictably**, even at rest. This suggests that the heart's **baseline** oxygen needs are not being consistently met.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Unstable angina can still be treated with nitrates, but they must be taken in <b>response</b> to the onset of chest pain, due to its unpredictable nature.</p>

              **Variant angina** (a.k.a. Prinzmetal angina) is caused by episodes of **vasospasm** which temporarily reduce blood flow to the heart.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is <b>less common</b> than traditional occlusive angina, and often occurs in those who suffer from other vasospastic disorders such as Reynaud's disease.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              **C-reactive protein** or CRP is an **inflammatory marker** that can be suggestive of the presence of atherotic lesions such as those seen in CAD.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is worth noting that CRP is <b>not</b> a specific marker of vascular damage, and can be elevated for a variety of reasons from infection and inflammatory diseases to cancer, or even pregnancy.</p>

              There is a **known link** between increased baseline level of CRP and cardiovascular disease, but elevated CRP alone **does not** confirm a diagnosis of CAD.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">CRP is <b>not</b> recommended as a screening test for CAD in healthy individuals without risk factors, due in part to its poor specificity.</p>

              Which of the plasma lipoproteins is protective against CAD? Why?

              **Lipoproteins** are microscopic "bubbles" of protein responsible for carrying lipids, which are normally not water-soluble, through the bloodstream.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">They are produced in the <b>liver</b>, and fall into categories based on their <b>size</b> and <b>contents</b>: from very-low density (VLDL) through intermediate (IDL) and high-density (HDL.)

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              These transport proteins start in the form of **VLDL** and travel through the bloodstream, where they gradually become LDL, then IDL, and finally HDL as the lipids they carry are taken up into the cells.

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Having a **higher HDL** level is considered beneficial, because these "bubbles" are nearly empty and thus can **absorb** free-floating lipids to be returned to the liver, protecting against the formation of **fatty deposits** on the arterial wall.

              The link between **diabetes** and CAD is complex, but it is known that diabetes results in a **2-4 times greater** risk of CAD-related mortality.

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Part of the process responsible for this increased risk involves an enzyme called **hormone-sensitive lipase** (HSL,) which is responsible for **mobilizing lipid stores** in situations where there is insufficient energy production from carbohydrates alone.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">HSL is called "hormone-sensitive" because it is <b>inhibited</b> by insulin; when there is sufficient energy production from glucose, fat mobilization is <b>not needed</b>.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              If insulin production is diminished, as occurs in DM, HSL activity is <b>increased</b> and serum lipid levels <b>increase</b>.

              Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries **narrows the lumen**, creating a smaller passage for blood and thus **reducing the blood supply** to the heart.

              Additionally, advanced lesions can **rupture**, triggering intravascular **clotting** which can suddenly occlude an entire coronary artery.

              **Percutaneous coronary intervention** is a minimally-invasive procedure for restoring and maintaining blood flow through the coronary arteries.

              In a PCI, a **guide wire** is inserted intravascularly through the radial or femoral artery, and advanced to the point of the blockage in the coronary arteries.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Once in place, a <b>balloon-tipped catheter</b> is passed over the guide wire and <b>inflated</b> within the narrowed vessel, physically <b>forcing the vessel open<b>.</p>

              In addition to this process, known as **balloon angioplasty**, PCI also involves the placement of a permanent **stent** which continues to hold the lumen of the vessel open after the catheter is removed.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Note that the plaque is <b>not removed</b> during a PCI. The obstruction is merely forced towards the walls of the vessel, and the stent prevents the vessel from collapsing back.</p>

              A **coronary artery bypass graft**, CABG (pronounced "cabbage",) or "heart bypass" is a surgical procedure to permanently route blood **around** an obstruction in the coronary arteries.

              The heart is either stopped or partially immobilized, and one or more veins taken from elsewhere in the body (such as the saphenous veins in the legs) are **grafted** to bridge the aorta to the distal side of the obstruction, allowing blood to **bypass** the obstruction and restoring perfusion of the distal tissue.

              Multiple grafts can be performed during the same surgical procedure, providing routes around multiple obstructions. For example, a CABG x3 or "**triple bypass**" consists of grafts to **three branches** of the coronary arteries.

              **Mitral regurgitation** occurs when the **mitral valve** between the left atrium and left ventricle **fails to close** completely after diastole, allowing blood to flow **back into the atrium** when the heart contracts.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The most common cause is <b>mitral prolapse</b>, in which the papillary muscles fail to hold the valve in place during systole, causing it to be forced open in the <b>opposite direction</b>, into the atrium.</p>
