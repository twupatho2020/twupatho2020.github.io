              Are all neoplasms malignant?

              **No**. The word **neoplasia**—meaning "new growth"—refers to **any tumor**, whether benign, "in situ," or malignant.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Think of the forms of abnormal growth we talked aobut during week 1: metaplasia, dysplasia, anaplasia, etc.</p>

              **Anaplasia**, which we already defined as cancerous, falls under the category of neoplasia; however, many growths such as dysplasias, uterine fibroids, or some colon polyps are **also** considered neoplastic.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In <b>some cases</b>, non-malignant neoplasia can progress to cancer, in other forms it does not.</p>

              The key to pick up here is that neoplasia has to be **different** from the surrounding tissue. Not all forms of excessive tissue growth are neoplastic.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH,) for example, the new tissue <b>isn't</b> tumorous; you simply have <b>more</b> prostate tissue than before.</p>

              Remember that benign tumors mostly "**keep to themselves**."
              <p class="fragment fade-up">They are <b>slow-growing</b>, <b>well-contained</b>, and <b>well-differentiated</b> (e.g. <b>not</b> anaplastic—look like "normal" cells.)

              They also generally have a **low mitotic index**, meaning that they take longer "breaks" before undergoing mitosis, so fewer cells are splitting at any given moment.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In general, just think of benign tumors as being non-invasive. They might cause problems locally, but for the most part, they're going to stay where they are.</p>

              In contrast, malignant tumors are **invasive** and like to grow into **everything**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">They are <b>fast-growing</b>, <b>poorly-contained</b>, and <b>poorly-differentiated</b> (e.g. they <b>are</b> anaplastic—look like stem cells.)

              As you might expect, they have a **high mitotic index**, meaning that new cells split shortly after reaching maturity, and a large percentage will be undergoing mitosis at a time.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In general, think of malignant tumors as being the "warmongers" of the cellular world; they want to spread everywhere!</p>

              **Staging**, on the other hand, looks at cancer on the **whole-body level**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">As a mnemonic, think about the stage of a theater; it encompasses the bigger picture, and contains the action of the entire scene.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It follows what is known as the <b>TNM system</b>, where the stage is represented by three numbers, e.g. T2 N1 M0.</p>

              The first number, **T**, represents the **size** and **extent** of the primary tumor.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The "<b>best</b>" stage for a <b>known</b> tumor is <b>T1</b>. Technically you <b>can</b> have T0, but this just means there's a suspected tumor that's still too small to find.</p>

              The second number, **N**, represents the infiltration of the tumor into nearby **lymph nodes**. Lymph vessels are like "superhighways" for metastasis, so this number is very important!

              The third number, **M**, represents the **metastasis** of the cancer to distant organs.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Unlike the other numbers, M can <b>only</b> be 1 or 0: the cancer has either metastasized, or it hasn't.</p>

              Typically, the behavior of these genes **inhibits the promotion** of mutations by either repairing the mutation, preventing the initiated cell from proliferating, or apoptosing the cell itself.

              Carcinogens, by definition, are **substances** that induce cancer. Many cancer-causing agents are carcinogens, but not all fit into this category.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) can induce cervical cancer, but it is not a <b>substance</b>, so we would not refer to it as a carcinogen.</p>

              Hormones can actually play a role in cancer **promotion**, which we'll talk about in a second. Basically, this means that they can take a mutated cell and help it to grow into a tumor.
