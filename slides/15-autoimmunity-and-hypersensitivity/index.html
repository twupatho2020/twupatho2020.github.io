              Hypersensitivity reactions are categorized according to the **underlying process** that causes them.
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Type 1</b> reactions are classified as "<b>IgE-mediated</b>" due to the role of <b>immunoglobulin E</b> in causing them.</p>

              Type I reactions include things such as **seasonal allergies**, **food allergies**, and **asthma**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These reactions develop due to improper activation of <b>antibody production</b> in the presence of an unrecognized substance.</p>

              **Helper T cells** (CD4 cells) "notice" the foreign substance and trigger **B cells** (another type of lymphocyte) to begin producing IgE antibodies to the allergen.

              When these antibodies detect the presence of the allergen again, they bind to and trigger **mast cells**, a type of granulocyte (also a form of WBC.)

              Type II reactions are classified as **tissue-specific**, because they are caused by the immune system responding to a **particular type** of tissue (either autoimmune or alloimmune.)

              Unlike type I reactions, type II reactions are mediated by **IgG** and **IgM**.

              Type III reactions are classified as **immune complex-mediated** and typically have **systemic** effects, targeting more than one organ (although the effect may be **greatest** in one organ.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Immune complexes</b> are clumps of antibodies bound together with free-floating antigens in the blood.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              When antibodies are created targeting the body's **own** proteins (autoantigens,) immune complexes can accumulate **faster** than the immune system can deal with them.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These complexes can get "stuck" in various tissues, leading to <b>inflammation</b> and <b>tissue damage</b> when leukocytes show up to deal with them.</p>

              What characterizes a type IV reaction? Give an example.
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Type IV reactions are classified as **cell-mediated** and are the only type of hypersensitivity reaction which **do not** directly involve antibodies.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Rather, they are caused by <b>overactive</b> CD4 "helper T" cells triggering CD8 cytotoxic "killer T" cells to induce <b>apoptosis</b> of healthy cells.</p>
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              In contrast to types I-III, which tend to occur fairly quickly in response to a stimulus, type IV are also known as **delayed hypersensitivity reactions** and can take several **days** to develop after exposure.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Examples include <b>contact dermatitis</b> (e.g. poison ivy,) <b>type 1 diabetes mellitus</b>, <b>inflamatory bowel disease</b>, <b>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</b>, and <b>multiple sclerosis</b>.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Type IV hypersensitivity is also responsible for the induration and erythema seen in a positive <b>TB skin test</b>, which is why you need to return in 2-3 days after placement of the intradermal tuberculin to have the test read.

              What makes an anaphylactic reaction life-threatening?

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The primary reasons that anaphylaxis is so dangerous are **respiratory distress** due to inflammation of the airways and bronchospasm, and **anaphylactic shock** (sudden, severe drop in blood pressure.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Combined, these two factors can lead to extreme systemic hypoxia and ultimately death, if the patient's oxygenation status is not improved.</p>

              Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another form of **type III hypersensitivity** with diffuse systemic effects. It involves the production of antibodies to several types of autoantigens, resulting in the immune system damaging tissues **throughout the body**.
