              **Atopy** (or being "atopic") refers to an individual's hypersensitivity to non-harmful environmental factors—in other words, having **allergies**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Atopy can present itself in any number of ways depending on the particular allergen(s) someone is sensitive to:</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">atopic dermatitis (<b>eczema</b>,) allergic rhinitis (such as <b>seasonal allergies</b>,) extrinsic <b>asthma</b>, etc.</p>

              **Anaphylaxis** is a severe and potentially **life-threatening** form of type I hypersensitivity reaction, caused by an extreme immune response to an allergen.

              Type II reactions are classified as **tissue-specific**, because they are caused by the immune system responding to a **particular type** of tissue (either autoimmune or alloimmune.)

              Unlike type I reactions, type II reactions are mediated by **IgG** and **IgM**.

              Type III reactions are classified as **immune complex-mediated** and typically have **systemic** effects, targeting more than one organ (although the effect may be **greatest** in one organ.)

              When antibodies are created targeting the body's **own** proteins (autoantigens,) immune complexes can accumulate **faster** than the immune system can deal with them.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These complexes can get "stuck" in various tissues, leading to <b>inflammation</b> and <b>tissue damage</b> when leukocytes show up to deal with them.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Type IV reactions are classified as **cell-mediated** and are the only type of hypersensitivity reaction which **do not** directly involve antibodies.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Rather, they are caused by <b>overactive</b> CD4 "helper T" cells triggering CD8 cytotoxic "killer T" cells to induce <b>apoptosis</b> of healthy cells.</p>

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              In contrast to types I-III, which tend to occur fairly quickly in response to a stimulus, type IV are also known as **delayed hypersensitivity reactions** and can take several **days** to develop after exposure.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Examples include <b>contact dermatitis</b> (e.g. poison ivy,) <b>type 1 diabetes mellitus</b>, <b>inflamatory bowel disease</b>, <b>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</b>, and <b>multiple sclerosis</b>.</p>

              Type IV hypersensitivity is also responsible for the induration and erythema seen in a positive <b>TB skin test</b>, which is why you need to return in 2-3 days after placement of the intradermal tuberculin to have the test read.

            <textarea data-template>
              **Autoimmunity** refers to any type of hypersensitivity reaction in which the immune system is targeting or attacking the body's **own tissues**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These are typically going to fall into categories II through IV (remember that type I represents allergies in which there is an external irritant.)</p>

              Like other type III reactions, RA tends to flare up and then remit over time. However, cumulative damage can cause the symptoms to worsen as the disease progresses.

              Stage 1 (**early RA**) is still mild and hasn't yet caused any permanent damage. The synovial lining of the joint becomes inflamed, causing swelling.

              Stage 3 (**severe RA**) begins to involve the bone, as the cartilage is worn down and the joint begins to malfunction. This is when the classic joint deformities of RA tend to appear.

              Graft rejection falls into three categories based on the speed with which it occurs:

              **Graft-versus-host disease** (GvHD) and **host-versus-graft disease** (HvGD) are two examples of **alloimmunity**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The process in each is similar, but as the names suggest, they occur in <b>different directions</b>.</p>

              In **graft-versus-host disease**, some WBCs from the organ or tissue **donor** make their way into the recipient, often in bone marrow or stem-cell transplants.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These cells recognize their new environment as foreign, causing them to attack the <b>recipient's body</b>.</p>

              In **host-vs-graft disease**, it is the **recipient's** immune system that recognizes the implanted organ or tissue as foreign and attacks the new tissues.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This results in the new tissue being damaged or destroyed, in a process known as <b>transplant rejection</b>.</p>
