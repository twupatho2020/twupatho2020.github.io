              **Activation** disorders refer to the inappropriate formation of clots in the absence of injury (the clotting cascade is activated when it shouldn't be.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This can include arterial or venous <b>stasis</b>, <b>roughened endothelium</b> as seen in atherosclerosis, or <b>hyperproduction</b> of clotting factors.</p>

              **Fibrinolysis** (breakdown of fibrin in blood clots) begins immediately as a clot forms, both to regulate the speed of clot formation and to eventually break down the clot fully once the injury is healed.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">If this system fails, <b>decreased inhibition</b> of clotting can result in excessive coagulation.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate are closely linked with **homocysteine**, an inflammatory substance which can be a risk factor for endothelial damage.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Low B<sub>12</sub> levels impairs the body's ability to recycle homocysteine, leading to increased levels in the blood and increased risk of clotting.</p>

              The **factor V Leiden** mutation is an abnormal form of clotting factor V (proaccelerin) which is "immune" to the normal regulatory mechanisms that inhibit clot formation.

            <textarea data-template>
              Dysfibrinogenemia is an **inherited condition** caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for fibrinogen.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This abnormal fibrinogen forms a different kind of fibrin that is not as effectively broken down by plasmin, leading to hypercoagulation.</p>

              Hemophilia is a group of **hereditary bleeding disorders** due to deficiency of clotting factors, which result in impaired coagulation.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Mild symptoms include <b>bruising</b>, <b>epistaxis</b> (nosebleeds,) increased <b>bleeding time</b>, etc.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">More pronounced symptoms include severe <b>internal bleeding</b> and <b>hemarthrosis</b> (bleeding into the joint space.)</p>

              Hemophilia **A** is linked to impaired production of clotting factor VIII (anti-hemophilic factor/AHF,) whereas hemophilia **B** is due to impaired production of factor IX (Christmas factor.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Hemophilia A is about <b>6 times</b> as common as hemophilia B. Both occur <b>almost exclusively</b> in male patients.</p>

              The mutation that causes hemophilia is a **recessive** mutation on the **X chromosome** (X-linked recessive mutation.)

            <textarea data-template>
              Men (XY) only have **one X chromosome**, so an abnormal gene on this chromosome will **always** be expressed.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Women (XX) have <b>two X chromosomes</b>, so the mutation will only be expressed if <b>both</b> chromosomes have the mutation.</p>

              In other words: women are protected by their "backup copy" of the X chromosome. If a woman inherits hemophilia from only one parent, she will be a **carrier** for the abnormal gene, but will not suffer from the disease.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Only by inheriting hemophilia from <b>both</b> parents can a woman actually develop the disease (extremely rare.)</p>

              ## Question 10
              ---
              What function does von Willebrand factor (vWF) serve in hemostasis?
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **von Willebrand Factor** (vWF) is a glycoprotein in the blood which plays an important role in **platelet adhesion** during the early stages of clot formation.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The underproduction of vWF is known as <b>von Willebrand Disease</b> (vWD,) which is also hereditary, but unlike hemophilia, affects men and women equally.</p>
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Symptoms of vWD are similar to those of hemophilia, although the most common forms of vWD tend to have only mild symptoms such as bruising and epistaxis (nosebleeds.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Internal bleeding, such as bleeding into the joints, is uncommon in most forms of von Willebrand disease but can occur in the more severe types.</p>
