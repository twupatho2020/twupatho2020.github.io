							## Question 1
							---
							Compare cerebral dysfunction and whole-brain death.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Remember the functions of the cerebrum and the brainstem:
							<p class="fragment fade-up">the <b>cerebrum</b> controls the "higher functions" of the brain, such as motor control, perception, information processing, etc.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up">the <b>braistem</b> controls the lower-level, basic functions that keep the body alive, such as breathing, controlling heart rate, etc.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Failure of part or all of the cerebrum (focal or diffuse dysfunction) causes loss of one or more **higher functions** of the brain.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This can affect anything from speech and language processing to facial recognition, or can be as severe as complete loss of conscious thought (coma.)</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Even with **complete loss** of cerebral function, the body can **still survive** under its own autonomic processes, e.g. without mechanical ventilation, ECMO, etc.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">When the <b>brainstem</b> is also nonfunctional (whole-brain death,) even basic autonomic processes cease and the body <b>will not</b> survive without continuous intervention.</p>

							## Question 2
							---
							Which neurotransmitter is involved in Alzheimer's disease?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of **dementia**, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of memory and cognitive function.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It occurs most often in the elderly, with an average age at diagnosis of 80.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							It is closely linked with a decline in <b>acetylcholine</b> production in the brain, and is commonly treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors which work to increase levels of ACh.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This treatment can improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but is <b>not a cure</b> and does not slow the progression of the disease.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Alzheimer's disease is the **sixth-leading** cause of death in the United States, just behind strokes.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The median survival for Alzheimer's patients is &lt;10 years even in those diagnosed as early as 65, worsening as age at diagnosis increases.</p>
						</textarea>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 3
							---
							Which two proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Two of the abnormalities noted in Alzheimer's disease involve the improper folding of **amyloid beta** (Aβ) and **tau** (τ) proteins.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Amyloid beta proteins form **amyloid plaques** (senile plaques,) clumps of misfolded protein that accumulate in the **extracellular** space.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Tau proteins, responsible for maintaining the structure of neurons, likewise misfold and clump together, leading to <b>tau tangles</b> inside the the neurons.</p>
						</textarea>

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 4
							---
							Name two other forms of dementia. Which has a genetic linkage?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Multi-infarct dementia**, sometimes called **vascular dementia**, is the second most-common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It is seen in patients who have suffered a series of minor strokes, due to the accumulation of permanent damage due to cerebral infarction.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							A rare cause of dementia is **Huntington's disease**, which is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting in progressive loss of brain cells.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It typically manifests itself at a much younger age than other forms of dementia (30-50 years,) with some cases being diagnosed even in children.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							There is currently no cure for Huntington's disease. Patients experience worsening loss of motor control, severely impacting independence and quality of life.
						</textarea>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 5
							---
							Describe the different types of seizures. Which is the most serious and represents a medical emergency?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Seizures are caused by **abnormal electrical activity** in the brain, and are typically categorized as either **focal** or **generalized**.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Focal** seizures affect only one part of the brain, so the signs and symptoms tend to be confined to one aspect of brain function: twitching, abnormal perception, etc.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Generalized** seizures affect both hemispheres of the brain, resulting in a wider variety of symptoms at once:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>Absence</b> (petit mal) seizures result in a brief loss of motor activity and decreased level of consciousness, usually just for a few seconds.</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>Tonic-clonic</b> (grand mal) seizures are the most common type in adults and result in muscle rigidity (tonic phase) and followed by alternating spasm and flaccidity (clonic phase.)</li>
							</ul>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The term **status epilepticus** refers to a single seizure or series of seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. This is an emergent condition and requires immediate treatment.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Patients experiencing SE are at risk of losing **airway patency**, and can experience **severe exhaustion** as a result of persistent clonic activity.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">SE is <b>usually</b> associated with a severe underlying problem such as an advanced brain tumor, rather than primary generalized epilepsy.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 6
							---
							Compare decerebrate and decorticate posturing.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Decerebrate** and **decorticate** posturing are very similar, and both are signs of **severe** brain damage.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Both involve whole-body rigidity with legs extended and plantar flexion at the ankles (toes pointed downward.)</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The major difference between the two can be observed in the positioning of the arms:
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Decerebrate</b> posturing features <b>extension</b> of the arms and neck, with the head thrown backwards and the arms held stiffly at the sides.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Decorticate</b> posturing features <b>flexion</b> of the arms, with the hands held over the chest (decorticate → arms "towards the core")</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 7
							---
							Compare intentional tremor and tremor at rest. Which is characteristic of Parkinson's disease?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Intentional tremor** is shaking that emerges when a person attempts to make an **intentional** movement, such as picking up an object.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This is contrasted with <b>tremor at rest</b>, which is present even when a person is meaning to stay still.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Tremor at rest** is commonly associated with Parkinson's disease, whereas intentional tremor is more commonly idiopathic (essential tremor) or secondary to multiple sclerosis or stroke.
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 8
							---
							Describe athetosis and chorea. Which is associated with Huntington's disease?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Athetosis and chorea are both forms of **dyskinesia**, or involuntary muscle movement, which are caused by several forms of neurological disorder and can occur either together (choreoathetosis) or separately.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Athetosis** primarily affects the hands (and sometimes the feet) and is commonly associated with **cerebral palsy**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It is usually described as a "<b>slow, writhing movement</b>" of the affected extremities, particularly the <b>fingers</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Chorea**, on the other hand, consists of **larger** "dance-like" movements that tend to affect the arms and legs, and is a major sign of **Huntington's disease**.
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 9
							---
							Describe an upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL.)
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							First, let's review the anatomy of the motor nerves:
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Motor signals originate in the <b>primary motor cortex</b> of the frontal lobe, anterior to the central sulcus.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The <b>upper motor neurons</b> carry the signal through the brainstem and down the <b>corticospinal tracts</b> of the spinal cord white matter.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The upper motor neuron travels down the spinal cord until it reaches the appropriate level, then synapses with a **lower motor neuron** in the ventral gray horn.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The lower motor neuron then carries the signal out the ventral root and to the skeletal muscle, synapsing with the muscle at the <b>neuromuscular junction</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							In an **upper motor neuron lesion**, the damage is either in the brain or in the upper spinal cord, **above** where the two neurons synapse in the ventral gray horn.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This means that the <b>brain</b> is cut off from the muscle, but the spine and the muscle are <b>still communicating normally</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							So how does this type of injury manifest itself?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							<ul>
								<li><b>hyperreflexia</b> – spinal reflexes are still intact but no longer regulated by the brain, leading to more pronounced reflexive responses</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>hypertonia</b> and <b>spastic paralysis</b> – muscles become stiff and difficult to move due to lack of impulse regulation from the brain</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">positive <b>Babinski's sign</b> – dorsiflexion and toe fanning in response to plantar stimulation (normal in babies, abnormal in adults)</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">typically <b>no atrophy</b> because the muscle is still innervated by the spine</li>
							</ul>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 10
							---
							Describe a lower motor neuron lesion (LMNL.)
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							In contrast to an UMNL, lower motor neuron lesions result from damage to the nerves **between the spine and the muscle**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This means that the muscle is cut off from the entire central nervous system and receives diminished or completely absent stimulus from the CNS.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							So how does this type of injury manifest itself?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							<ul>
								<li><b>hyporeflexia</b> – spinal reflexes are diminished or absent due to lack of communication between the muscle and the spine</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>hypotonia</b> and <b>flaccid paralysis</b> – muscles become permanently limp due to lack of innervation of the muscle</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">negative <b>Babinski's sign</b> – no dorsiflexion in response to plantar stimulation</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>denervation atrophy</b> because the muscle is receiving diminished signals from the entire CNS</li>

							## Question 11
							---
							What is the hallmark of a basal ganglion lesion?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Lesions to the basal ganglia (in the midbrain) typically manifest in the form of **dyskinesias**, or involuntary muscle movement.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The basal ganglia contain synapses related to motor control, among several other functions, so damage here can cause signals to be sent down the spinal cord without any intentional stimulus in the motor cortex.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This can result in <b>athetosis</b> and <b>chorea</b>, which we've talked about, as well as the tremors seen in <b>Parkinson's disease</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>

							## Question 12
							---
							What is the hallmark of cerebellar syndrome?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The primary manifestation of cerebellar damage is **ataxia**, or loss of voluntary muscle coordination.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This can result in many abnormalities, from slurred speech and tremors to trouble eating or swallowing.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							In can also cause an **ataxic gait**, where cerebellar damage leads to extreme difficulty walking and a wide, shuffling stance when trying to walk.

							## Question 13
							---
							Describe some of the effects of unifocal cortical lesions.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Remember that **focal** lesions to the cerebral cortex are typically going to affect **one form** of higher information processing.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**agnosia** – inability to process sensory stimuli, e.g. recognizing objects, smells (umbrella term)
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>asterognosis</b> – inability to recognize shapes by tactile stimulus</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>prosopagnosia</b> – "face blindness," inability to recognize faces</p>

							## Question 14
							---
							Compare coup vs. contrecoup injuries.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							A **coup** injury is an injury to the brain due to head trauma, which occurs **directly** from the source of the trauma.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">For example, if you hit the <b>front</b> of your head, a coup injury will result in damage to the <b>front</b> of the brain.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							A **contrecoup** injury is a secondary injury which can occur due to the momentum from the blow slamming the brain against the **opposite side** of the skull.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">For example, if you hit the <b>front</b> of your head, a contrecoup injury will result in damage to the <b>back</b> of the brain.</p>

							---
							Define concussion, contusion, and laceration.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**concussion** – a **mild** brain injury due to blunt trauma, which can result in loss of consciousness but does **not** cause severe, permanent brain damage
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>contusion</b> – a more <b>severe</b> form of injury in which there is bruising (internal bleeding) of the brain tissue due to small blood vessel rupture</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>laceration</b> – an even <b>more severe</b> form of brain injury in which the <b>meninges</b> are torn or ruptured, often due to a skull fracture</p>
						</textarea>

							Describe thrombotic, embolic, and hemorrhagic strokes. Which type is most common?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**thrombotic** stroke – a type of **ischemic** infarction caused by "**stationary**" clotting within the brain's vascular system
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>embolic</b> stroke – a type of <b>ischemic</b> infarction caused by a <b>moving</b> vascular obstruction from elsewhere<br /><span style="font-size:0.75em;">(includes <b>thromboembolic</b> strokes due to traveling clots, e.g. PE)</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>hemorrhagic</b> stroke – the <b>most serious</b> form of stroke, caused by bleeding in the brain, e.g. subarachnoid or intracranial hemorrhage</p>

							## Question 17
							---
							When is fungal meningitis normally seen? Which is more serious, bacterial or viral meningitis?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Meningitis—inflammation of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord—can be caused by several forms of infection, but fungal meningitis is particularly **rare**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It is usually observed as an <b>opportunistic</b> infection in patients who are <b>already immunocompromised</b>, such as those with AIDS.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The most serious form of meningitis is **bacterial** (hence why we vaccinate against *Neisseria meningitidis*, one common pathogen causing bacterial meningitis.)

        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 18
							---
							What part of the brain is involved in Parkinson's disease? Which neurotransmitter is involved?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by the death of neurons in part of the **substantia nigra**, an area of the basal ganglia in the midbrain.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							These are largely **dopaminergic** neurons, meaning that the primary neurotransmitter that they emit is **dopamine**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The deficiency of dopamine caused by the death of these neurons is often treated with <b>L-DOPA</b>, a precursor to dopamine that makes it easier for the brain to produce it.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 19
							---
							What process leads to the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS?) What is the hallmark of this disease?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Multiple sclerosis is characterized by the loss of **oligodendrocytes** and the **demyelination** (destruction of the **myelin sheath**) of neurons in the central nervous system.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It is believed to be at least partially autoimmune (type IV hypersensitivity,) caused by T cells attacking myelin and causing inflammation and scarring of the neuronal axons.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							MS has many varied symptoms, but one telltale sign is impaired eye movement, particularly paralysis of the **medial rectus** muscle.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This causes the eyes to no longer be parallel when looking to the sides; when looking right, for example, the right eye will face right but the left eye will face forward.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 20
							---
							In which sex is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is more common? What causes the deterioration that patients experience?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							ALS is caused by the progressive death of **motor neurons**, resulting in spasticity, twitching, and over time, denervation atrophy.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This loss of motor function is eventually fatal as the worsening nerve damage begins to cause respiratory failure. Most ALS patients die within 3-4 years of diagnosis.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							ALS is **slightly** more common in men than in women (about 20%,) particularly among those diagnosed at a young age.
