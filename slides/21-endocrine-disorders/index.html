              Most endocrine problems fall into one of two categories:
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>hypersecretion</b> – the body produces <b>too much</b> of a particular hormone</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>hyposecretion</b> – the body produces <b>too little</b> of a particular hormone</p>

              The causes of these imbalances can vary, but **most** endocrine disorders occur on the "producing" end.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">However, some endocrine disorders can occur on the "receiving" end. When a hormone is produced in appropriate amounts but the target doesn't respond to it correctly, we call this <b>receptor resistance</b>.</p>

              The thyroid gland is normally controlled by TSH production in the **pituitary gland**—but in Graves' disease, the thyroid breaks free of this control mechanism and starts **overproducing** hormones.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In response to this imbalance, the pituitary tries to throttle back the thyroid gland by <b>decreasing</b> TSH production, resulting in high T<sub>3</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> but <b>low</b> TSH levels.</p>

              Hypothyroidism, like many other endocrine disorders, can have **multiple causes**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The root cause of low thyroid hormone levels can be in either in <b>the thyroid itself</b>, or in the <b>hypothalamus/pituitary gland</b> which regulate it.</p>

              In **primary hypothyroidism**, the problem is **in the thyroid**. The thyroid is being stimulated, but is not responding to TSH by producing T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> as it should.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">As a result, in primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are <b>elevated</b>, as the pituitary gland is trying harder to get the thyroid to respond, but it isn't working.</p>

              <p class="fragment fade-up">As a result, in secondary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are <b>low</b>, as the pituitary is either failing to produce TSH, or the hypothalamus is failing to stimulate the pituitary gland with TRH.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              **Hashimoto's thyroiditis**, like Graves' disease, is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid. However, the effect is **opposite**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Unlike Graves' disease, which is a type II (tissue-specific) hypersensitivity, Hashimoto's is a type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity in which cytotoxic T cells <b>attack</b> and gradually <b>destroy</b> the thyroid gland.</p>

              This results in primary **hypothyroidism**, and the lab values are **inverted** vs. Graves' disease. Rather than TSH being low to try to slow down the thyroid, TSH will be **high** as the pituitary gland tries to compensate for T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> being **low**.

              Myxedema is a type of **swelling** (edema) which can occur in severe cases of **hypothyroidism**, and occasionally in hyperthyroidism (as in Graves' disease.)

            <textarea data-template>
              Cushing's syndrome refers to a group of symptoms associated with **hypercortisolism**—the excess of **glucocorticoids**, a type of hormone produced in the **cortex** of the **adrenal glands**.

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              In **primary** hypercortisolism, the problem is directly in the **adrenal cortex**. Because of this, **adrenocorticotropic hormone** (ACTH) levels will be **low**, as the pituitary gland is trying to slow down the adrenal gland, but it isn't working.

              In **secondary** hypercortisolism, the problem is in the **pituitary gland**. This will result in ACTH levels being **high**, because the pituitary gland is overproducing ACTH and the adrenal cortex is simply responding to the high ACTH levels.

              **Cortisol** is one of the body's primary **stress hormones** and the primary **glucocorticoid** produced in the adrenal cortex.

              **Cushing's syndrome**—the symptoms of excess **glucocorticoids** in the body—can occur for a few different reasons.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">One of these causes is <b>Cushing's disease</b>, a form of <b>secondary hypercortisolism</b> caused by a pituitary tumor.</p>

              **Type 1** diabetes, sometimes called **insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus** (IDDM,) is caused by the destruction of the **beta cells** in the islets of the pancreas, which are responsible for secreting **insulin** into the bloodstream.

              This results in **low insulin levels**, causing the cells of the body to fail to take in glucose from the blood to fuel their metabolic needs, which in turn leads to an increase in blood glucose.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes tend to develop it at a young age, with the average age at diagnosis being around 14.</p>

              Type 1 diabetes is unique in that the body **does not produce** (or greatly underproduces) insulin, meaning that patients **must** receive supplemental insulin via subcutaneous injection in order for normal cellular metabolism to occur.

              Insulins vary by type, with some taking effect very quickly but not lasting very long, and others lasting for a much longer time, even an entire day or more. Often, multiple types are **combined** to achieve appropriate insulin levels throughout the day.

              **Type 2** diabetes, sometimes called **non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus** (NIDDM,) is caused by insulin **resistance**, meaning that insulin may be produced in normal amounts, but fails to trigger the intake of glucose by the cells.

              Like type 1 diabetes, this also results in an elevated blood glucose level. This excess glucose is then excreted in the urine (**glycosuria**,) and water is also lost by osmosis, leading to **polyuria**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">One of the greatest risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes is <b>obesity</b>. Currently, about 90% of diabetes cases fall into the category of type 2 diabetes.</p>

              One of the most common effects is that the newborn's blood glucose will **sharply drop** after birth when the baby is no longer connected to the mother's bloodstream via the umbilical cord.

              Glucose in the mother's blood can pass freely through the placenta into the fetus's circulation, triggering fetal **insulin production**.

              The major function of **parathyroid hormone** in the body is the regulation of **calcium** absorption and storage.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Higher levels of PTH will <b>increase</b> serum calcium by stimulating <b>osteoclast</b> activity and enhancing <b>renal</b> and <b>intestinal</b> (re)absorption of calcium.</p>

              As such, **hyperparathyroidism** results in **hypercalcemia**—abdominal pain, weakness, arrhythmias, etc.—and decreased **bone density** from resorption of bone calcium.
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> results in <b>hypocalcemia</b> and the associated symptoms: numbness, spasm, hyperreflexia, seizures, or even cardiac arrest.</p>

              **Primary** hyperparathyroidism results from the **overgrowth** of the parathyroid glands, leading to an excessive production of parathyroid hormone.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This results in a state of <b>hypercalcemia</b>, or excessive calcium in the blood, because calcium is being reclaimed from the bones when it is not needed.</p>

              **Secondary** hyperparathyroidism, on the other hand, is the result of a normal physiological response to **hypocalcemia**, usually due to **kidney disease** and the excess loss of calcium in the urine.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In response to low calcium levels, the parathyroid glands initiate the normal response, which is to leech calcium from the bones to fuel the body's needs.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Over time, this can result in serious decreases in bone density, just like primary hyperparathyroidism.</p>
