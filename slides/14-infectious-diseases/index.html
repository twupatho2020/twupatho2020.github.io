              **Yes**. Mortality from communicable disease has accounted for as much as **1 in 3** deaths as recently as 1990.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This number continues to fall with new advances in medicine and increased access to healthcare in developing countries, reaching 25% by 2010 and now closer to 20%.</p>

              **Cytokines** (tiny signaling proteins) produced by the immune system help direct neutrophils towards the site of infection, where they release granules to attack the invading bacteria. Neutrophils and macrophages then attempt to phagocytose (envelop) the bacteria to prevent the infection from spreading.
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Antibodies</b> attach onto surface antigens on the exterior of the pathogen, "marking" it as a target for the immune system.</p>

              The **complement system**, a complex series of enzyme reactions that contribute to the immune response, is also triggered by antibodies binding to an infectious agent. This system leads to inflammation and the stimulation of phagocytes.
