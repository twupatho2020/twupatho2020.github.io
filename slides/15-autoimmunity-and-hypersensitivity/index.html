							## Question 1
							---
							Compare autoimmunity with hypersensitivity. Give some examples of each.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**hypersensitivity** – an umbrella term for an inappropriate or exaggerated immune response to a substance, foreign or otherwise (e.g. allergies, or...)
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**autoimmunity** – a hypersensitive immune response to the body's **own tissues** (e.g. lupus, type 1 diabetes)
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>alloimmunity</b> – a hypersensitive immune response to the presence of <b>someone else's tissues</b> (e.g. organ rejection, HDN)</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
        <section>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 2
							---
							What characterizes a type I hypersensitivity reaction? Give an example.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Hypersensitivity reactions are categorized according to the **underlying process** that causes them.
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Type 1</b> reactions are classified as "<b>IgE-mediated</b>" due to the role of <b>immunoglobulin E</b> in causing them.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Type I reactions include things such as **seasonal allergies**, **food allergies**, and **asthma**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">These reactions develop due to improper activation of <b>antibody production</b> in the presence of an unrecognized substance.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Helper T cells** (CD4 cells) "notice" the foreign substance and trigger **B cells** (another type of lymphocyte) to begin producing IgE antibodies to the allergen.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">After repeated exposures, the amount of IgE in the blood steadily increases until it is enough to produce an immune response.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							When these antibodies detect the presence of the allergen again, they bind to and trigger **mast cells**, a type of granulocyte (also a form of WBC.)
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The mast cells then <b>degranulate</b>, dumping <b>histamine</b> into the extracellular space and producing <b>leukotrienes</b> and <b>prostaglandins</b>, leading to an inflammatory response.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							This reaction can include:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>swelling</b>, <b>pruritus</b> (itching,) <b>runny nose</b></li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>urticaria</b> (hives)</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">cardiac <b>dysrhythmias</b></li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">drop in blood pressure (<b>hypotension</b>)</li>
							</ul>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
        <section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 3
							---
							Identify a severe example of a type I reaction.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The most severe form of type I hypersensitivity reaction is **anaphylaxis**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Swelling and bronchospasm contribute to <b>respiratory distress</b>, and combined with a sudden drop in BP can lead to <b>anaphylactic shock</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
        <section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 4
							---
							What characterizes a type II reaction? Give an example.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Type II reactions are classified as **tissue-specific**, because they are caused by the immune system responding to a **particular type** of tissue (either autoimmune or alloimmune.)
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Unlike type I reactions, type II reactions are mediated by **IgG** and **IgM**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This type of response can lead to the <b>destruction</b> or <b>malfunction</b> of the target cell, depending on the nature of the specific disorder.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							One example of a type II reaction is **Graves' disease**, a type of **hyperthyroidism**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Antibodies form that target the <b>receptors</b> for <b>thyroid stimulating hormone</b> (TSH) on the thyroid, <b>triggering</b> them and causing the thyroid to become <b>overproductive</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							This category also includes:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>transfusion reactions</b> and <b>hemolytic disease of the newborn</b> (but <b>not</b> transplant rejection)</p>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">Many autoimmune disorders that result in damage to a <b>specific organ</b>:<br /><span style="font-size:0.75em;" class="fragment fade-up">autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, myasthenia gravis</span></li>
							</ul>
						</textarea>

							## Question 5
							---
							What characterizes a type III reaction? Give an example.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Type III reactions are classified as **immune complex-mediated** and typically have **systemic** effects, targeting more than one organ (although the effect may be **greatest** in one organ.)
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Immune complexes</b> are clumps of antibodies bound together with free-floating antigens in the blood.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							When antibodies are created targeting the body's **own** proteins (autoantigens,) immune complexes can accumulate **faster** than the immune system can deal with them.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">These complexes can get "stuck" in various tissues, leading to <b>inflammation</b> and <b>tissue damage</b> when leukocytes show up to deal with them.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Examples of type III reactions include **systemic lupus erythematosus** (SLE,) **rheumatoid arthritis**, and **serum sickness** (an adverse reaction to certain types of drugs or blood plasma donation.)
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 6
							---
							What characterizes a type IV reaction? Give an example.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Type IV reactions are classified as **cell-mediated** and are the only type of hypersensitivity reaction which **do not** directly involve antibodies.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Rather, they are caused by <b>overactive</b> CD4 "helper T" cells triggering CD8 cytotoxic "killer T" cells to induce <b>apoptosis</b> of healthy cells.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							In contrast to types I-III, which tend to occur fairly quickly in response to a stimulus, type IV are also known as **delayed hypersensitivity reactions** and can take several **days** to develop after exposure.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Examples include <b>contact dermatitis</b> (e.g. poison ivy,) <b>type 1 diabetes mellitus</b>, <b>inflamatory bowel disease</b>, <b>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</b>, and <b>multiple sclerosis</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Type IV hypersensitivity is also responsible for the induration and erythema seen in a positive <b>TB skin test</b>, which is why you need to return in 2-3 days after placement of the intradermal tuberculin to have the test read.

							## Question 7
							---
							What makes an anaphylactic reaction life-threatening?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The primary reasons that anaphylaxis is so dangerous are **respiratory distress** due to inflammation of the airways and bronchospasm, and **anaphylactic shock** (sudden, severe drop in blood pressure.)
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Combined, these two factors can lead to extreme systemic hypoxia and ultimately death, if the patient's oxygenation status is not improved.</p>

							## Question 8
							---
							What are the two types of immunodeficiencies? What is the hallmark of immunodeficiency?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**primary (congenital) immunodeficiency** – an **inherited** immunodeficiency that is **present at birth** and not caused by an underlying condition
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This includes <b>DiGeorge syndrome</b> (decreased/absent production of T-cell lymphocytes,) as well as problems with <b>B-cell or complement production</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency** – an immunodeficiency which is **caused by** (secondary to) another condition which was not present at birth
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This includes <b>acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</b> (AIDS,) <b>leukemia</b>, <b>stress</b> or <b>trauma</b>, etc.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The typical result of any type of immunodeficiency (primary or secondary) is the occurrence of **opportunistic infections**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Impaired immune response makes it <b>easier</b> for pathogens to invade the body and multiply before the immune system can stop an infection from happening.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
        <section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 9
							---
							Give an example of an acquired immunodeficiency. Why is this a concern in elderly patients?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Some examples:
							<p class="fragment fade-up">In <b>HIV/AIDS</b>, the virus attacks and kills CD4 T cells in the bloodstream.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Leukemia</b> prevents the bone marrow from producing WBCs that function properly.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Multiple myeloma</b> is a cancer of the B cells which results in impaired antibody production.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Acquired immunodeficiency is a concern in elderly patients because the immune system naturally <b>slows down</b> with age, leaving older patients <b>more susceptible to infection</b> and less capable of fighting off infection when it occurs.
						</textarea>

							## Question 10
							---
							What is scleroderma? Which sex is more likely to be affected? Is it common?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the **skin**, although it is a **type III hypersensitivity** so it can also have systemic effects.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							It results in **hardened patches of skin**, sometimes involving the underlying muscle and bone causing apparent deformity, as well as shortness of breath, kidney failure, and a wide range of other problems.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Scleroderma is <b>fairly rare</b>, affecting roughly 40/100,000 people, and like almost all forms of autoimmunity, <b>primarily affects women</b>.
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
        <section>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 11
							---
							What is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE?) How does this disorder affect the body?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another form of **type III hypersensitivity** with diffuse systemic effects. It involves the production of antibodies to several types of autoantigens, resulting in the immune system damaging tissues **throughout the body**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The most common symptoms include <b>fatigue</b>, <b>joint pain</b>, <b>photosensitivity</b> of the skin, and <b>chest pain</b>/<b>dyspnea</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							As a type III hypersensitivity, the severity of lupus symptoms tends to fluctuate with the level of immune complexes in the body, with periodic <b>flares</b> interspersed with periods of remission.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Like autoimmunity in general, SLE is also <b>more common in women</b> than in men.</p>

							## Question 12
							---
							What is the hallmark of SLE?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The most immediately recognizable sign of lupus is called a **malar rash** or "butterfly rash" across the upper cheeks, just below the eyes.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It appears in <b>about half</b> of SLE patients, and may persist for years or can come and go, especially with exposure to sunlight.</p>
