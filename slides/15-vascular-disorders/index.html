              The most common type of peripheral arterial disease is **atherosclerosis**.

              In general, the effect of atherosclerosis is **reduced perfusion** of tissues, particularly peripheral tissues.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This results in <b>poor oxygenation</b> and <b>poor nutrition</b> of the tissues, and poor perfusion of the kidneys can cause <b>acid-base imbalance</b>.</p>

              Rupture of which type of aneurysm has a high mortality rate?

            <textarea data-template>
              The rupture of **any** aneurysm is potentially fatal, but **abdominal aortic aneurysms** (AAAs) have a particularly high mortality rate upon rupture due to the sheer amount of internal bleeding that can result.

              **Cerebral** aneurysms are also particularly problematic due to the effects of **hemorrhagic stroke**; loss of perfusion of brain tissue can easily be fatal, not to mention increased ICP.

              **Thoracic outlet syndrome** is a disorder affecting one or both **upper extremities**, caused by impingement of the nerves and blood vessels passing through the **thoracic outlet**.

              It can be considered a vascular disorder because the **subclavian artery** passes through the the thoracic outlet, and thus TOS can impede blood flow to the arm.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Symptoms vary depending on type, but usually include <b>pain</b> to part or all of the hand and arm, and can include <b>weakness</b>, <b>pallor</b>, and <b>atrophy</b>.</p>

              **NSAIDs** may help control inflammation thus reducing the severity of the impingement, and **physical therapy** can likewise be helpful.
