              A **target cell** is a cell which contains **receptors** on its cell membrane that trigger a response to the presence of a specific hormone.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Hormones circulate throughout the body, but only the cells <b>targeted</b> by the hormone will actually change their behavior in response to the presence of that hormone.</p>

              Some hormones, such as **insulin**, target cells throughout the body. Others, such as **thyroid-stimulating hormone** (TSH) and **adrenocorticotropic hormone** (ACTH) act only on the cells of a particular organ.

              The endocrine system is one of the body's **messaging systems**; along with the nervous system, it represents the body's mechanism of allowing distant parts of the body to communicate with each other.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Whereas the nervous system allows near-instant communication between the body and the brain, the endocrine system is <b>slower</b>, but allows organs to communicate with each other directly.</p>

              Because of this, endocrine disorders can have **many** varied effects throughout the body, in practically every organ. The presentation depends on the function of the particular hormone that is imbalanced.

              What is the underlying cause of diabetes insipidus (DI?) What does the word "diabetes" refer to? How does this relate to the clinical disorder?

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The term diabetes comes from the Greek word **diabḗtēs**, meaning "passing through." This refers to the excessive thirst and excessive urination experienced by those with diabetic disorders.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The two general categories of diabetes—<b>diabetes mellitus</b> and <b>diabetes insipidus</b>–mean "sweet diabetes" and "insipid (tasteless) diabetes," respectively.</p>

              These names refer to one of the major clinical differences between DM and DI—the presence or absence of **glycosuria** (glucose in the urine,) which occurs in DM but not in DI.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In general, diabetes insipidus has to do with a <b>decrease</b> in the action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH.)</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It's important to remember that, unlike diabetes mellitus, which we usually refer to as just "diabetes," diabetes insipidus <b>does not involve</b> insulin or blood glucose levels.</p>

              ## Question 6

              Why might an increase in plasma osmolality be seen in diabetes insipidus?

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Plasma osmolality (colloidal concentration of the blood) tends to **increase** in diabetes insipidus due to the **excessive loss of fluid** through the kidneys.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) is normally produced in the hypothalamus and released by the pituitary gland in response to <b>high</b> osmolality, telling the kidneys to <b>retain</b> water.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">If this regulation fails and ADH is produced in insufficent quantities, or is "ignored" by the kidneys, fluid loss will <b>increase</b> and the blood will become <b>more concentrated</b> (higher osmolality.)</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              **Neurogenic** ("nervous system-caused") DI occurs when ADH is **insufficiently produced** by the hypothalamus, or insufficiently released by the pituitary gland.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The lack of ADH leads the kidneys to shed too much water, leading to an increase in urine output and plasma osmolality.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              **Nephrogenic** ("kidney-caused") DI occurs when ADH is produced in appropriate amounts, but the kidneys **fail to respond** to the presence of the hormone.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The kidneys shed water despite being signaled to hold onto it, again leading to an increase in urine output and plasma osmolality.</p>

              **Dipsogenic** ("thirst-caused") DI, a.k.a. **primary polydipsia** occurs when the root cause of the polyuria is due to **excessive fluid intake**, usually due to an increase in the **hypothalamic thirst mechanism**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The increased thirst drive causes the patient to drink excess water, and the decrease in ADH occurs as a normal physiological response to high blood volume.</p>

              **Hypersecretion** of ADH (**too much ADH**, the opposite of neurogenic DI) leads to **hyponatremia** (excess sodium concentration) through excess **water retention** in the kidneys.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">ADH signals the kidneys to hold onto water, leading to a decrease of plasma osmolality throughout the body (more water, same quantity of electrolytes.)</p>

              Insulin resistance causes the body's cells to be unable to access glucose as an energy source, resulting in elevation of blood sugar and the use of alternate energy sources such as fatty acids.

              Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders that cause the inability of the adrenal glands to produce certain hormones, resulting in <b>compensatory hyperplasia</b>.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The exact presentation depends on the particular form of CAH, but <b>corticosteroids</b> such as <b>cortisol</b> and <b>aldosterone</b>, as well as <b>sex hormones</b> are affected.</p>

              In **primary** hypocortisolism, ACTH levels are **high** because the pituitary gland is trying to **speed up** the adrenal glands, but it isn't working because of the adrenal damage.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In <b>secondary</b> hypocortisolism, ACTH levels are **low** because the adrenal gland is working properly but is being **understimulated** by the pituitary gland.</p>

              In both forms of hypocortisolism, **potassium** can reach dangerously high levels (hyperkalemia,) due to the relative lack of **aldosterone** production and the failure to expel potassium in the urine.
