              Septicemia refers specifically to an **infection of the blood** (usually bacterial,) as opposed to solid tissues.

              ---
              How does the body respond to bacterial infection?

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Cytokines** (tiny signaling proteins) produced by the immune system help direct neutrophils towards the site of infection, where they release granules to attack the invading bacteria. Neutrophils and macrophages then attempt to phagocytose (envelop) the bacteria to prevent the infection from spreading.
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Antibodies</b> attach onto surface antigens on the exterior of the pathogen, "marking" it as a target for the immune system.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              The **complement system**, a complex series of enzyme reactions that contribute to the immune response, is also triggered by antibodies binding to an infectious agent. This system leads to inflammation and the stimulation of phagocytes.

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The general term for any type of fungal infection is **mycosis**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The most common type of mycosis is <b>candidiasis</b> (also known as <b>thrush</b>,) which is caused by the fungi of the genus Candida (most commonly C. albicans.)</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The classic presentation of candidiasis is as a **thick, off-white film** covering the mucous membranes, which can be easily scraped off to reveal underlying **erythema**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Most commonly, it occurs in the <b>mouth</b> and on the <b>tongue</b>, but also is the cause of vaginal <b>yeast infections</b>.</p>

              How is malaria transmitted?

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Malaria** is a deadly infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus **Plasmodium**, most common in tropical regions and especially in sub-Saharan Africa (90%+.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Malaria can be caused by any of five species of protozoa, but <b>P. falciparum</b> is responsible for <b>most</b> deaths due to malaria.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The protozoa that cause malaria are spread via **mosquito bite**; the mosquito bites an infected host, and carries the disease to its next target, infecting them as well.

              ## Question 9
              ---
              How does the body fight viruses?
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Many of the mechanisms that the body uses to fight viruses are the same as for bacteria: B cells produce **antibodies** which help recognize known pathogens, CD8 **cytotoxic T cells** attack infected cells, etc.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">However, there is one protective mechanism that is particularly useful in defending against viruses: <b>interferons</b>.</p>

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Interferons** are a type of **cytokine** (small signaling protein) which serve as the body's "alarm bell" vs. viral infection.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Cells infected with viruses release interferons, which both resist viral replication within the cell and warn nearby cells to ramp up their viral defenses.</p>

              What cells are the target of the HIV virus?

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preferentially targets **CD4 T cells**, also known as **T-helper cells**, part of the active immune system which helps coordinate the immune response to particular types of infection.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Part of what makes HIV so dangerous is that, if not adequately treated, it can kill so many CD4 cells that the body can no longer respond adequately to other infections.</p>

              ---
              Describe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS.)
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the pathogen responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS,) but infection with HIV **does not** imply that a person suffers from AIDS.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Rather, AIDS is a <b>progression</b> of HIV infection if not adequately treated or if treatment is unsuccessful, such as with drug-resistant strains or in patients who are already immunocompromised.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              HIV is particularly dangerous because it preys on the cells of the immune system, simultaneously crippling the immune system while it reproduces and making it difficult for the body to fight back.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Disease progression is monitored through tracking <b>CD4 count</b>, or the number of T-helper cells in the blood. AIDS occurs when the CD4 count reaches <b>dangerously low</b> levels (&lt;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.)</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              When the CD4 cells are depleted, the body is unable to fight off other infections, and opportunistic infection may occur which can be life-threatening.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">With new treatment strategies such as antiretroviral therapy, AIDS-related mortality in HIV patients has declined by about 40% since 2010.</p>

              Incidence of many infections can be prevented through **vaccination**, which results in acquired immunity to a particular pathogen.
