              **Primary hemostasis** refers to the initial phase of **platelet aggregation** that occurs during **early** clot formation.
              <p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Primary hemostatic disorders</b> cause a disruption in the formation of the platelet plug, either due to <b>decreased</b> platelets or <b>failure</b> to aggregate.</p>

              **Secondary hemostasis** refers to the second phase of clot formation where the platelet plug is **strengthened** with fibrin and turned into a full clot.

              Describe von Willebrand disease.

            <textarea data-template>
              **von Willebrand Factor** (vWF) is a glycoprotein in the blood which plays an important role in **platelet adhesion** during the early stages of clot formation.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The underproduction of vWF is known as <b>von Willebrand Disease</b> (vWD,) which is also hereditary, but unlike hemophilia, affects men and women equally.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Symptoms of vWD are similar to those of hemophilia, although the most common forms of vWD tend to have only mild symptoms such as bruising and epistaxis (nosebleeds.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Internal bleeding, such as bleeding into the joints, is uncommon in most forms of von Willebrand disease but can occur in the more severe types.</p>

              **Thrombocytopenia**, or a decreased number of platelets, can cause a variety of symptoms: but most of them are **bleeding**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These include <b>petechiae</b> and <b>purpura</b> (small, dot-like bruises,) as well as <b>expstaxis</b> (nosebleeds,) <b>hematochezia</b>, <b>hematuria</b>, increased <b>menstrual flow</b>, and <b>slowed clotting</b>.</p>

              Thrombocytopenia can have a few different causes.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">First, <b>production</b> could be decreased, as in aplastic anemia, leukemia, nutritional deficiencies, etc.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Second, platelets could be prematurely <b>destroyed</b>, as occurs in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP.)</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Third, platelets could be <b>used up</b> by improper clotting, as in diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP.)</p>

              Hemophilia is a group of **hereditary bleeding disorders** due to deficiency of clotting factors, which result in impaired coagulation.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Mild symptoms include <b>bruising</b>, <b>epistaxis</b> (nosebleeds,) increased <b>bleeding time</b>, etc.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">More pronounced symptoms include severe <b>internal bleeding</b> and <b>hemarthrosis</b> (bleeding into the joint space.)</p>

              Hemophilia **A** is linked to impaired production of clotting factor VIII (anti-hemophilic factor/AHF,) whereas hemophilia **B** is due to impaired production of factor IX (Christmas factor.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Hemophilia A is about <b>6 times</b> as common as hemophilia B. Both occur <b>almost exclusively</b> in male patients.</p>

              Why is sickle cell anemia called an anemia? Why is it a hyper-coagulatory disease?

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Sickle cell** anemia is a recessive genetic defect in the DNA coding for hemoglobin, resulting in RBCs that collapse into a "moon" or "sickle" shape when they become deoxygenated. It occurs almost exclusively in **black patients**.

          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              These malformed cells can become tangled with each other and stuck in the arteries, leading to sudden episodes of pain referred to as **sickle cell crisis**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Once they malfunction, these RBCs are targeted for hemolysis and broken down, resulting in a <b>hemolytic</b> anemia.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              The reason for **hypercoagulation** in sickle cell disease is not fully understood, but one contributing factor is blood **stasis** due to the obstruction from tangles of sickled RBCs.

              ## Question 8
              ---
              What is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC?) Why can bleeding occur in this state?
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Disseminated intravascular coagulation** (DIC) is an often-acute state of impaired coagulation caused by platelets and clotting factors being **used up** to create small, unnecessary blood clots all over the body.
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              It's often caused by **sepsis** (systemic infection,) and results in tiny clots forming all over the body, which deplete the body's stores of materials for coagulation.

              ## Question 9
              ---
              Describe thrombocythemia. How is it related to von Willebrand factor?
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Thrombocythemia** (or, more commonly **thrombocytosis**) is the **opposite** of thrombocytopenia—having **too many** platelets in the blood.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Paradoxically, this can actually cause a <b>decrease</b> in coagulation, as there is no longer enough vWF to adhere the platelets to each other.</p>
            </textarea>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              You can think of this as being too many "bricks" and not enough "mortar." Without enough vWF to stick the larger number of platelets together, there is difficulty forming a complete **platelet plug**.
