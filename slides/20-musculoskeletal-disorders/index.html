              **Arthritis** is a general term referring to joint pain and stiffness that can be caused by any of a number of factors.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The three major forms that we'll be talking about are <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b>, <b>osteoarthritis</b>, and <b>gout</b>, but many other diseases, including infections and autoimmune diseases (lupus, scleroderma, etc.) can also cause joint problems.</p>

              **Osteoarthritis**, also referred to as **degenerative joint disease** (DJD,) is the most common type of arthritis and primarily affects the elderly.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is caused by the progressive loss of the <b>joint cartilage</b> and subsequent bone remodeling due to the lack of protective cartilage within the joint.</p>

              **Rheumatoid arthritis**, on the other hand is **autoimmune**. It is a type III (**immune complex-mediated**) hypersensitivity.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Because of this, it tends to have flares and periods of remission, similar to other type III reactions like lupus and scleroderma.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The age of onset is significantly younger than in osteoarthritis; most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60.</p>

              **Septic arthritis** or **infectious arthritis** is caused by an infection (usually bacterial) of the joint space, commonly in large joints such as the hip or knee.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is often an opportunistic infection, affecting the immunocompromised such as AIDS patients and those on long-term steroid therapy. It can also occur as a complication of joint replacement surgery.</p>

              **Ankylosing spondylitis** is technically a form of arthritis, but it is particularly rare and almost exclusively affects the intervertebral joints of the spine.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It causes the vertebrae of the spine to <b>fuse together</b>, which can result in severe <b>kyphosis</b> (hunched-forward posture.)</p>

              **Rheumatic fever** is an inflammatory disease that can result from untreated streptococcal infections, such as strep throat. (We've talked about this before in the context of rheumatic heart disease.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In addition to inflammation of the heart valves, rheumatic fever can also cause inflammation in the joints, which can present similarly to other forms of arthritis.</p>

              What is the pathophysiology of gout?

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              The symptoms of gout are caused by the deposition of **urate** crystals in the joints, due to elevated levels of **uric acid** in the blood.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Uric acid is produced during the metabolism of <b>purines</b>, a type of chemical found in high concentrations in red meat and fish.</p>

              Why do people with severe osteoporosis of the spine appear "bent over?"

            <textarea data-template>
              Osteoporosis is a progressive decrease in the **density** of bone that often accompanies aging, particularly in women.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The best method of diagnosis is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging, but unfortunately this is still rather expensive.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Osteoporosis can affect the spinal curvature because the decrease in bone density leads to the **body** of the vertebrae (located in the anterior of the spinal column) becoming vertically compressed (compression fracture.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This decrease in the height of the vertebral body causes the entire spinal column to bend forward, leading to <b>kyphosis</b>.</p>

              Both osteoporosis and osteomalacia fall into the category of **osteopenia**—disorders of decreased bone density. The difference is the mechanism that causes this decrease in density.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance between bone formation and resorption (osteoclast & osteoblast activity.) This can often be <b>hormonally-driven</b>, and is especially common in post-menopausal women.</b>

              Osteomalacia is a <b>nutritional problem</b>, caused by a deficiency of the vitamins and minerals required for the production of bone matrix—usually vitamin D.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Risk factors include malabsorption of nutrients due to <b>gastric bypass surgery</b> as well as <b>lack of sun exposure</b>.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              Paget's disease is a disorder characterized by excessive, improper **bone remodeling**. It most commonly occurs in those over the age of 55.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Excessive osteoclast activity causes the <b>rapid breakdown</b> of bone matrix, which is then <b>replaced</b> with improperly formed bone.</p>

              This process results in an **excess** of bone, but this new bone is much more brittle due to lower density and more extensive vasculature.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Bones commonly affected include the pelvis, which can lead to hip fractures, and the skull, which can present as frontal bossing (bulging forehead.)</p>

              Muscular dystrophy is a **group** of muscle diseases that result in the progressive loss of muscle tissue throughout the body.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Most forms of MD are <b>childhood diseases</b>, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (the most common type) typically being diagnosed in toddlers.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The most common types of MD are seen almost exclusively in <b>boys</b>, although there are some forms that affect both sexes equally.</p>

              Life expectancy varies greatly between the various types of MD, ranging from normal (Becker MD) to as young as 15-45 (Duchenne MD.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">There is currently no cure for muscular dystrophy, and eventually it results in the inability to walk.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In about 30% of cases, muscular dystrophy is also accompanied by cognitive impairment, although many MD patients have normal cognitive development.</p>

              Scoliosis is defined as **lateral** (side-to-side) curvature of the spine, greater than 10 degrees.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">For reference: excessive forward curvature of the spine is termed <b>kyphosis</b> and excessive backward curvature of the lower spine is <b>hyperlordosis</b>.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              Early screening for scoliosis is important because it tends to onset at around 10-15 years old and **progresses most quickly** during puberty due to the accelerated bone growth during this time.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is about <b>ten times</b> more common in girls than in boys.</p>
