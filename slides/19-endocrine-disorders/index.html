              A **target cell** is a cell which contains **receptors** on its cell membrane that trigger a response to the presence of a specific hormone.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Hormones circulate throughout the body, but only the cells <b>targeted</b> by the hormone will actually change their behavior in response to its presence.</p>

              Some hormones, such as **insulin**, target cells throughout the body. Others, such as **thyroid-stimulating hormone** (TSH) and **adrenocorticotropic hormone** (ACTH) act only on one type of cell.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">If a cell <b>lacks receptors</b> for a particular hormone, that hormone <b>cannot</b> alter the cell's function.</p>

              The endocrine system is one of the body's **messaging systems**; along with the nervous system, it represents the body's mechanism of allowing distant parts of the body to communicate with each other.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Whereas the nervous system allows near-instant communication between the body and the brain, the endocrine system is <b>slower</b>, but allows organs to communicate with each other directly.</p>

              Because of this, endocrine disorders can have **many** varied effects throughout the body, in practically every organ. The presentation depends on the function of the particular hormone that is imbalanced.

            <textarea data-template>
              The term diabetes comes from the Greek word **diabḗtēs**, meaning "passing through."

              The two general categories of diabetes—**diabetes mellitus** and **diabetes insipidus**–mean "sweet diabetes" and "insipid (tasteless) diabetes."
              <p class="fragment fade-up">These names refer to one of the major clinical differences between DM and DI—the presence or absence of <b>glycosuria</b> (glucose in the urine,) which occurs in DM but <b>not</b> in DI.</p>

              In general, diabetes insipidus has to do with a **decrease** in the action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH.)

              Why would an increase in plasma osmolality be seen in diabetes insipidus?

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Plasma osmolality (colloidal concentration of the blood) tends to **increase** in diabetes insipidus due to the **excessive loss of fluid** through the kidneys.

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) is normally produced in the hypothalamus and released by the pituitary gland in response to **high** osmolality, telling the kidneys to **retain** water.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">If this regulation fails and ADH is produced in insufficent quantities, or is "ignored" by the kidneys, fluid loss will <b>increase</b> and the blood will become <b>more concentrated</b> (higher osmolality.)</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              **Neurogenic** ("nervous system-caused") DI occurs when ADH is **insufficiently produced** by the hypothalamus, or insufficiently released by the pituitary gland.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The lack of ADH leads the kidneys to shed too much water, leading to an increase in urine output and plasma osmolality.</p>

          <section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
            <textarea data-template>
              **Nephrogenic** ("kidney-caused") DI occurs when ADH is produced in appropriate amounts, but the kidneys **fail to respond** to the presence of the hormone.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The kidneys shed water despite being signaled to hold onto it, again leading to an increase in urine output and plasma osmolality.</p>

              **Dipsogenic** ("thirst-caused") DI, a.k.a. **primary polydipsia** occurs when the root cause of the polyuria is due to **excessive fluid intake**, usually due to an increase in the **hypothalamic thirst mechanism**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The increased thirst drive causes the patient to drink excess water, and the decrease in ADH occurs as a normal physiological response to high blood volume.</p>

              **polyuria** – increased volume of urine produced, usually very dilute (low specific gravity) due to excess water being lost

            <textarea data-template>
              **Hypersecretion** of ADH (**too much ADH**, the opposite of neurogenic DI) leads to **hyponatremia** (excess sodium concentration) through excess **water retention** in the kidneys.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">ADH signals the kidneys to hold onto water, leading to a decrease of plasma osmolality throughout the body (more water, same quantity of electrolytes.)</p>

              The primary effect of hyperparathyroidism is a **decrease in bone density**, due to the action of parathyroid hormone on stimulating **bone resorption**.

            <textarea data-template>
              **Primary** hyperparathyroidism results from the overgrowth of the parathyroid glands, leading to an excessive production of parathyroid hormone.

              **Secondary** hyperparathyroidism, on the other hand, is the result of a normal physiological response to **hypocalcemia**, usually due to **kidney disease** and the excess loss of calcium in the urine.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">In response to low calcium levels, the parathyroid glands initiate the normal response, which is to leech calcium from the bones to fuel the body's needs.</p>

              This results in **low insulin levels**, causing the cells of the body to fail to take in glucose from the blood to fuel their metabolic needs, which in turn leads to an increase in blood glucose.

              In **primary** hypercortisolism, the problem is directly in the **adrenal cortex**. Because of this, **adrenocorticotropic hormone** (ACTH) levels will be **low**, as the pituitary gland is trying to slow down the adrenal gland, but it isn't working.
