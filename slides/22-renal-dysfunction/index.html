              List some causes of urinary tract obstruction.

              In general, urinary tract obstruction can occur due to either blockage **inside** the urinary tract or pressure from **outside** the urinary tract.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Blockage from within the urinary tract typically occurs due to <b>renal calculi</b>—a.k.a. "kidney stones."</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">External pressure can occur due to <b>tumor</b> growth near the urinary tract, or during <b>pregnancy</b> as the uterus presses on the ureters.</p>

              Urinary tract obstruction can also be caused by damage to the **nervous system**, a condition known as **neurogenic bladder**. We'll talk about this in a later question.

              When the flow of urine out of the body is obstructed, the **production** of urine doesn't slow down—this causes urine to back up into the bladder, first resulting in **bladder distension** and abdominal discomfort.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">If the bladder fills to its limit, pressure will either push urine out of the urethra if possible (causing <b>incontinence</b>) or up the ureters towards the kidneys (causing <b>hydronephrosis</b>.)</p>

              Most UTIs fall into the category of **cystitis**, or bladder infection.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">This makes sense if you think about it, because UTIs are typically "ascending," i.e. the pathogen comes from <b>outside</b> and "ascends" the urethra to the bladder.</p>
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Eventually, if untreated, the infection can continue up the ureters and reach the kidneys, causing <b>pyelonephritis</b>, or kidney infection.</p>

              Remember how we said that UTIs typically ascend the urethra from the external environment?
              <p class="fragment fade-up">The reason UTIs are more common in women is simple: the bladder is simply <b>closer</b> to the urinary orifice in women, meaning a <b>shorter path</b> for pathogens to reach the bladder.</p>

              Acute pyelonephritis typically occurs as a progression of **untreated cystitis**—bacteria from a bladder infection continue to ascend up one or both ureters, spreading the infection to the kidneys.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Normally, the continuous flow of urine <b>down</b> the ureters helps prevent this, but <b>urinary stasis</b> or <b>vesicoureteral reflux</b> (VUR) can allow bacteria to travel "upstream."</p>

              **Nephrotic syndrome** and **nephritic syndrome** refer to two distinct sets of symptoms associated with damage to the **glomeruli**—the main "filtering" mechanism of the kidneys.

              This damage causes the "holes" in the glomeruli to become bigger, allowing proteins to leak into the renal tubules and become excreted in the urine (**proteinuria**.)

              **Chronic glomerulonephritis** is typically autoimmune in nature, and includes glomerular inflammation due to **Goodpasture syndrome** as well as other disorders such as **systemic lupus erythematosus** (SLE.)
              <p class="fragment fade-up">Regardless of the cause, the inflammation causes scarring (<b>fibrosis</b>) of the glomeruli, and the increase in glomerular permeability can cause <b>dilation</b> of the renal tubules.</p>

              We described this earlier—remember that nephr**otic** syndrome is **non-inflammatory** and results in the glomeruli being permeable to **proteins** and **lipids**, but still retaining **cells** in the bloodstream (so **no** hematuria.)

              The key findings in nephrotic syndrome are **proteinuria** and **lipiduria**, often resulting in **edema**. These bigger molecules leak into the kidneys, and the kidneys have no mechanism to reclaim them, so they pass into the urine.

              Kidney function is indicated using **glomerular filtration rate** (GFR,) which is a measure of how much fluid is passing through the glomeruli and into the kidneys. As kidney failure progresses, GFR goes **down** and urine production **decreases**.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">It is typically measured by looking at the <b>creatinine</b> levels in the blood, since creatinine is produced at a fairly constant rate by the body and is normally excreted in the urine.</p>

            <textarea data-template>
              If the serum creatinine level is **high**, this indicates a **low** GFR, as the kidneys are not doing a very good job of clearing creatinine from the blood.
              <p class="fragment fade-up">A healthy person's GFR will vary based on age, but the normal range is typically <b>90–120</b> ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (the units are weird because GFR is adjusted for body size.)</p>

              **Renal failure** is diagnosed when kidney function has decreased to about **25%** of its normal value—generally **25-30** ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or lower.

              **Azotemia** (from the French "azote" meaning "nitrogen") refers to the buildup of nitrogen-containing compounds such as **urea** and **creatinine** in the blood, caused by renal insufficiency.

              **Uremia** occurs when these nitrogen-containing compounds build up to a level that starts producing **symptoms**, such as **fatigue**, **pruritus** (itching,) and **altered mental status**.

              **Prerenal** kidney failure ("before" the kidneys) occurs when there is **hypoperfusion** of the kidneys—they are failing to filter the blood because the blood isn't being **delivered** effectively.

              One common method for dealing with renal failure is **hemodialysis**: actually **removing** the patient's blood from the body, filtering it in a machine, and putting it back in.
