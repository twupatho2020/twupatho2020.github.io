							## Question 1
							---
							Are the numbers of deaths worldwide from infection significant? What percentage of deaths do they represent?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Yes**. Mortality from communicable disease has accounted for as much as **1 in 3** deaths as recently as 1990.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This number continues to fall with new advances in medicine and increased access to healthcare in developing countries, reaching 25% by 2010 and now closer to 20%.</p>

							Why are communicable diseases such a prominent cause of death?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Strains of infectious disease are **constantly evolving**: new diseases emerge, old diseases evolve and recur in new forms, existing treatments become ineffective as pathogens adapt to resist them.

							## Question 9
							---
							How does the body respond to bacterial infection?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Cytokines** (tiny signaling proteins) produced by the immune system help direct neutrophils towards the site of infection, where they release granules to attack the invading bacteria. Neutrophils and macrophages then attempt to phagocytose (envelop) the bacteria to prevent the infection from spreading.
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>Antibodies</b> attach onto surface antigens on the exterior of the pathogen, "marking" it as a target for the immune system.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The **complement system**, a complex series of enzyme reactions that contribute to the immune response, is also triggered by antibodies binding to an infectious agent. This system leads to inflammation and the stimulation of phagocytes.

							</ul>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">

					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">

							A **virion** (virus particle) is a tiny intracellular parasite—not technically "alive," but do contain RNA or DNA that code for the proteins used to contruct additional virions.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Their genetic material is contained in a protective protein shell known as a <b>capsid</b>. The specific structure varies; some viruses have a protective lipid bilayer, others do not.</p>

							## Question 14
							---
							Describe the life cycle of a virus. Describe some cellular effects of viruses.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Viruses have no way of reproducing on their own and **must** rely on host cells to proliferate.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The virus first attaches itself to the membrane of the host cell, and is either <b>absorbed</b> or <b>injects</b> its genetic material into the host.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							This genetic material is integrated with the host DNA and results in the host cell producing large numbers of identical virions.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Once viral replication reaches a critical level, the host cell <b>sheds</b> the new virus particles, usually through either budding or apoptosis.</p>

							## Question 15
							---
							What are the consequences of HIV infection when it progresses to AIDS?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the pathogen responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS,) but infection with HIV **does not** imply that a person suffers from AIDS.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Rather, AIDS is a <b>progression</b> of HIV infection if not adequately treated or if treatment is unsuccessful, such as with drug-resistant strains or in patients who are already immunocompromised.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							HIV is particularly dangerous because it preys on the cells of the immune system, reproducing and crippling the immune system simultaneously and making it difficult for the body to fight back.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Disease progression is monitored through tracking <b>CD4 count</b>, or the number of T-helper cells in the blood. AIDS occurs when the CD4 count reaches <b>dangerously low</b> levels (&lt;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.)</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							When the CD4 cells are depleted, the body is unable to fight off other infections, and opportunistic infection may occur which can be life-threatening.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">With new treatment strategies such as antiretroviral therapy, AIDS-related mortality in HIV patients has declined by about 40% since 2010.</p>

							## Question 16
							---
							Describe some countermeasures against pathogens.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Incidence of many infections can be prevented through **vaccination**, which results in acquired immunity to a particular pathogen.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Pharmacological treatment after infection begins depends on the pathogen: antibiotics, antiviral drugs, antifungal drugs, etc.</p>
