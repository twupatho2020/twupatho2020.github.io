						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 1
							---
							Describe the composition of blood. What is the difference between plasma and serum? What is the difference between collecting blood in green- and red-topped tubes?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							About half of the volume of blood (55%) is **blood plasma**, a dilute solution of plasma proteins in water.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The other half (45%) is composed of <b>formed elements</b>, almost all of which is <b>red blood cells</b>.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Blood **plasma** is the entire fluid-and-solute portion of blood **without** formed elements (so no RBCs, WBCs, or platelets.)
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Plasma samples are formed by fractionating whole blood in a centrifuge, then removing the heavier formed elements.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Blood **serum** is very similar to blood plasma, but has also been stripped of **fibrinogen** and other clotting factors.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Whole blood is encouraged to clot and <b>then</b> centrifuged, and the clotted material removed along with the formed elements.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Green blood collection tubes **prevent** clotting with heparin for tests that can be run with **plasma** with clotting factors present.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Red tubes <b>encourage</b> clotting with tiny glass or silica particles for tests that require blood <b>serum</b>.</p>
						</textarea>

							## Question 2
							---
							What components are seen in the plasma fraction?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Blood plasma is mostly **water**, with most of the rest being made up of **plasma proteins** in solution:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">92% water</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">4% albumin</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">3% other plasma proteins<br /><span style="font-size:0.75em;">(immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, etc.)</span></li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">1% "other stuff"</li>
							</ul>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Part 1, Question 3
							---
							Why would a patient who has nephrotic syndrome be more susceptible to infection? Why would liver disease lead to bleeding?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							We talked about **nephrotic syndrome** before during the Fluid & Electrolytes unit—increased permeability of the renal glomeruli allows proteins to leak into the urine.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							This affects all plasma proteins, including **immunoglobulins**, which play a crucial role in immune defense.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Decreased level of immunoglobulins in the blood results in an impaired immune response and greater risk of infection.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Remember that the liver plays a crucial role in **fat absorption** in the small intestine through the production of bile.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Decreased liver function impairs absorption of fats, and by association, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Vitamin K deficiency** is a common consequence of liver disease, leading to impaired synthesis of clotting factors.
							<p style="font-size:0.75em;" class="fragment fade-up">(In fact, many clotting factors are also <b>produced</b> in the liver.)</p>
						</textarea>

						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 4
							---
							Why is hemoglobin A1c a good indicator of glucose control over a 4 month period?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Glycated hemoglobin** (HbA1c) is hemoglobin that has been **chemically bound** to glucose in the bloodstream.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This process is <b>irreversible</b> and, once it occurs, will be present for the entire lifetime of the RBC—about 4 months.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The more glucose is present in the blood, the more often this reaction occurs, and the higher the HbA1c level will be.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Unlike direct measurement of blood glucose, HbA1c doesn't fluctuate. If your glucose is fine today, but has been high for the past few months, your HbA1C will be high, too.</p>
						</textarea>

							## Question 5
							---
							Compare petechiae and purpura.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Petechiae**, **purpura**, and **ecchymosis** (bruising) are three categories of **hematoma**—localized bleeding under the skin.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">All of these can be caused by coagulative and vascular disorders, or by trauma.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The three terms are differentiated on the basis of <b>size</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**petechiae** – tiny "pin-prick" spots less than 2–3 mm in size
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>purpura</b> – medium-sized spots larger than petechiae but smaller than 1 cm</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up"><b>ecchymosis</b> – general term for any bruising larger than purpura</p>
						</textarea>

							## Question 6
							---
							What vitamins and nutrients are needed for red blood cell (RBC) production?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The main three: **iron**, **folate** (vitamin B<sub>9</sub>,)<br />and **vitamin B<sub>12</sub>**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Iron is a component of <b>hemoglobin</b>, and B-vitamins play an important role in the proper <b>maturation</b> of RBCs.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 7
							---
							What is intrinsic factor? Where is it produced and what does it do? Why do bariatric surgery and kidney disease lead to anemia?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Intrinsic factor** is a protein produced by the **parietal cells** of the stomach, which aids the absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in the ileum.
						</textarea>
					</section><section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Gastric bypass surgery "skips over" part of the stomach, **reducing** the amount of intrinsic factor entering the ileum and impairing B<sub>12</sub> absorption.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This leads to <b>pernicious</b> (vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency) anemia.</sub>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The kidneys are responsible for the production of **erythropoietin**, a hormone that triggers the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Chronic kidney disease can lead to a deficit of erythropoietin, causing an underproduction of red blood cells—<b>not</b> pernicious!</p>
						</textarea>

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 8
							---
							Why do dark urine and light feces signal liver disease? Which form of bilirubin is excreted in bile?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Let's review the unit on liver disease—unconjugated **bilirubin** is produced as a byproduct of hemolysis during the recycling of old RBCs.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Unconjugated bilirubin is combined with acid to produce <b>conjugated</b> bilirubin, which is then normally excreted into the bile.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							In liver disease, bilirubin either **fails to be conjugated** due to hepatocyte damage, or **fails to be excreted** due to cholestasis. This results in an increase in bilirubin **in the blood**, which can cause jaundice.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Decreased levels of bilirubin in the intestines and increased levels in the blood (excreted in the kidneys) lead to lighter stool and darker urine.</p>
						</textarea>

							## Question 9
							---
							What factors lead to platelet disintegration?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							The protein **plasminogen**, produced in the liver, plays an important role in the breakdown of blood clots.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It is an <b>inactive form</b> of the enzyme <b>plasmin</b>, which breaks down the <b>fibrin</b> that holds clots together.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Plasminogen naturally "sticks" to the fibrin and integrates itself into the clot, but has no effect its inactive form.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Over time, it becomes converted to <b>plasmin</b> and begins to cleave the fibrin molecules, slowly breaking down the clot over the course of several days.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 10
							---
							What is plasmin? What is tPA, and what is its medical use?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) is a naturally-occuring enzyme that is **slowly** released by damaged cells, **activating** the plasminogen contained in clots by converting it to **plasmin**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">This slow release of endogenous tPA is responsible for demolishing clots as the natural healing process of the underlying tissue progresses.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**alteplase** (Activase) is a synthetic form of tPA, used as a "clot buster" for STEMI, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, etc.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">It tends to be used only in extreme circumstances due to risk of <b>uncontrolled bleeding</b>.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 11
							---
							Why is tPA better than streptokinase?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**tPA** and **streptokinase** are both thrombolytic drugs, but tPA is **fibrin-specific** meaning that it acts **only** on fibrin and not on clotting factors.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Combined with its short half-life, this makes tPA great for treating acute blood clots without causing sustained systemic thrombolysis.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							In contrast, streptokinase is **fibrin non-specific**, meaning it also breaks down **fibrinogen**, causing systemic suppression of **new** clots and increasing the risk of bleeding.
						</textarea>

							## Question 12
							---
							What is the consequence of anemia?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Generally speaking, anemia results in a systemic decrease in the **oxygenation** of tissues.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Decrease in number of RBCs or their hemoglobin content decreases the "carrying capacity" of the blood, lowering the effectiveness of the circulatory system at conducting gas exchange.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 13
							---
							What conditions can contribute to anemia?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							<ul>
								<li>Chronic kidney disease (CKD)</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">Nutritional deficiencies: B<sub>12</sub>, folate, iron</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">Thalassemia (genetic disorder of increased hemolysis)</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">Misshapen RBCs: sickle cell disease, spherocytosis</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)</li>
							</ul>

							## Question 14
							---
							Describe some common signs and symptoms of anemia.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							<ul>
								<li><b>fatigue</b> and <b>weakness</b></li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>tachycardia</b>, <b>chest pain</b>, <b>shortness of breath</b></li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>pallor</b> (pale or yellowish skin)</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>neurological symptoms</b>: headache, tinnitus, lightheadedness</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up"><b>nail "spooning"</b> (primarily in iron-deficiency anemia)</li>
							</ul>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 15
							---
							What are the body's compensatory mechanisms for anemia?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Two of the most noticeable compensations are **tachycardia** and **tachypnea** as the body attempts to increase oxygen supply to the tissues.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">As the blood gets thinner, systemic vascular resistance naturally decreases, which also has the effect of increasing cardiac output.</p>
							<p class="fragment fade-up">The body may also shunt blood towards more important areas such as the heart and brain.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 16
							---
							Why is sickle cell disorder considered an anemia?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							**Sickle cell** anemia is a recessive genetic defect in the DNA coding for hemoglobin, resulting in RBCs that collapse into a "moon" or "sickle" shape when they become deoxygenated. It occurs almost exclusively in **black patients**.
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							These malformed cells can become tangled with each other and stuck in the arteries, leading to sudden episodes of pain referred to as **sickle cell crisis</b>**.
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Once they malfunction, these RBCs are targeted for hemolysis and broken down, resulting in a <b>hemolytic</b> anemia.</p>
						</textarea>
					</section>
        </section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## Question 17
							---
							What are nutritional anemia and aplastic anemia?
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-transition="slide">
						<textarea data-template>
							Nutritional anemia is linked to a <b>deficit of nutrients</b> required for proper RBC synthesis (iron, B<sub>12</sub>, folate.)
							<p class="fragment fade-up">Aplastic anemia is a <b>very rare</b> form of anemia characterized by the <b>underproduction</b> of many types of blood cells, including RBCs. It is potentially fatal and is treated with bone marrow transplant.</p>
